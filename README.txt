We analyze data related to global climate change using 3 data sets from the dslabs package: temp_carbon, greenhouse_gases, and historic_co2.

analysis.R
- loads the libraries
- loads the data sets and saves them as R objects in the rdas directory
- plots all graphs and saves them in the figs directory
